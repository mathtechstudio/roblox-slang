    Roblox Slang - Type Definitions
    
    This file provides type definitions for Luau LSP autocomplete.
    DO NOT MODIFY BY HAND - Your changes will be overwritten!
    
    Generated from translation files in your project.
    To update type definitions, edit your JSON/YAML files and run:
        roblox-slang build
    
    Usage:
    Place this file alongside your Translations.lua module.
    Your IDE/LSP will automatically provide autocomplete and type checking.
